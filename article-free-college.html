      Bernard Sanders has proposed an interesting concept in his 2016 race for the presidency:
      a free education for college students. This is obviously a major issue that endears the Vermont
      senator to much of the American youth, but it may not be all that it is cracked up to be.
      Education has been a recurring issue in American politics, but the element of a tuition free
      collegiate level education is relatively new. Senator Sanders' plan involves new tax structures,
      and will greatly affect the lives of many American people from all walks of life.
      <br/><br/>
      Now, because bias is a huge factor in this line of work and I'm relatively new to the online writing community, I'll begin with some background on myself. My name is Jake Houtman. I'm a sixteen year old high school student, and I live in Southeast Michigan. Both of my parents are engineers that work for General Motors, and my brother is a student at Kettering University. Everyone in my family loves cars, and my first and current car is a 1986 Pontiac Fiero GT. I, like everyone in my family, am very interested in mechanical engineering and I will most likely pursue that as a major in college.
      <br/><br/>
      Here in Michigan, there are some good engineering colleges, like the University of Michigan, Michigan Technological University, and Kettering University (formerly the General Motors Institute). However, tuition at these schools can be extremely high, with total costs ringing in at a rough average of $25,000 to $30,000 per year for an in-state student. Now, I'm not going into the college world completely unprepared, as my parents did start college savings accounts for both my brother and I. However, the deal with my parents is that I am required to pay for half of my college tuition. With that deal, a four year school could put me $50,000 in debt before I even enter the job market. That's coupled with the fact that I am not guaranteed a job coming out of college. There will be hundreds, even thousands of students exactly like me: jobless and in debt, some $100,000 or even more than that. So free college would just eliminate this debt, and that's the end of that, right?
      <br/><br/>
      Wrong. Sanders' plan has an interesting method of payment, a speculation tax on Wall Street investments and taxing the top 1% of the population at extremely high rates. This is a serious issue because Senator Sanders' plans will hurt my family, a middle-class family, with high tax rates on investments that my parents have made and will make, and the investments I will make as an adult. With this tax, the stock sales will come to a standstill, and the market will crash. This will lead us into another economic depression of a 1929 caliber, after which the economy will take another blow with the inflation of American dollars as a result of point to on Sanders' guideline to 'Reducing Income and Wealth Inequality,' raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour, in a poorly thought out attempt to get minimum wage workers out of poverty. Basically the only thing the average american gains out of this is being 'more equal' economically, and for a few years before it crashes and burns, a free college education. Free college, specifically, is point seven on his path. Sanders' website states, "Making tuition free at public colleges and universities throughout America. Everyone in this country who studies hard should be able to go to college regardless of income." Sounds great, in theory, but there are multiple issues here. As was already established, the Wall Street tax will not cover a free college education for every high school student who "studies hard." Before getting offended and branding me as a 'rich, greedy' conservative who is too selfish to share my wealth, realize that I am a hardworking high school student. I have three Advanced Placement Classes (eligible for college credit) this year as a sophomore, and I am set to be enrolled in four more next year. If anyone should be bummed that free college won't work, it's my family, because I work my butt off. But fear not, there is an alternative way to combat high college costs. For the best example of this, I turn to Kettering University in Flint, Michigan.
      <br/><br/>
      Kettering is a private school with a yearly cost of $36,980 (2014-15 year), which is pretty steep. What is unique about Kettering, however, is their co-op program. Every three months, students enrolled at the college alternate between studying traditionally with a book and notes in a classroom and working a hands-on job in their field. Kettering works primarily with automotive companies, like GM, Magna, Brembo, and other manufacturers and suppliers, but the learning model could be applied to other areas of study. Students can work a 40 hour week making good pay, at an increasing rate with each year of completed education. Some of the companies even offer to pay a portion of tuition, with an obligation to stay with the company a few years after graduation. Students are given jobs right out of college, and companies are able to train their new wave of engineers while they are still learning. It's a win-Â­win scenario, without the involvement of the government. If more colleges followed this system and students are wise with their money, student loans could be as low as one-tenth of what they are now, or potentially even nonexistent. Heck, these kids could even come out of college with a little bit of cash saved up. The point being, of course, that there are better ways to solve tuition problems than by involving the government.
