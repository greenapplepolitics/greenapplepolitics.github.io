      The National Rifle Association is an interest group based around advocating gun rights. Formed in 1871, the National Rifle Association(NRA) has always been at the forefront of American politics and will continue to be in the years to come. Its founders, William Church and George Wingate, intended for the NRA to advance rifle marksmanship. Both veterans of the Civil War, the two were disappointed with the lack of skill shown by their comrades on the battlefield and wanted to heighten the level of competency among the men. Two years after its inception, the NRA opened its first rifle range: Creedmoor. Lasting only nine years until 1892, Creedmoor was taken back by the state of New York after political opposition arose due to the advocacy of rifles. This hinted at the long, controversial history the NRA was to have. The NRA established a new shooting range in New Jersey and began targeting the youth for competitions. As it developed during the first half of the twentieth century and received further criticism, the NRA put more focus into firearms safety and education. In 1932, after debate over the second amendment failed to cease, the NRA established the Legislative Affairs Division to bolster its legal impact. In 1975, the NRA aimed to further cement its political stature by forming the Institute for Legislative Action. The impacts of these organizations have highlighted the controversy of the NRA's 144 year history.
      <br /><br />
    	The NRA has always maintained interest in many issues regarding firearms. They have gone through three main shifts of focus, however. At its beginning, the NRA's focus was on developing people's skills at rifle marksmanship. Not long after opening its first shooting range, the NRA began to target the youth for being more involved in marksmanship practice. This became one its most dominant programs; by 1906, over 200 boys were involved in competitive shooting events with the NRA. As the youth program developed throughout the twentieth century, the NRA shifted focus to gun safety and education. While competitive programs continued to flourish, gun safety became the major focus of the group and rose to the forefront in the minds of most members. In 1949, the NRA worked with the state of New York to institute the country's first hunter education program. Eleven years later, in 1960, the NRA expanded its educational efforts by establishing a firearms training course for police officers. This was the first of its kind in the country and set the precedent for the NRA's image of safety and security, an image that would become subject to controversy in the years to come. A third shift in focus occurred toward the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century after the NRA came under scrutiny for promoting the use of firearms. For what they called attacks on the second amendment, the NRA formed the Institute for Legislative Action in 1975. Since then, its primary focus has been advocating gun ownership rights.
      <br /><br />
    	Currently, the NRA focuses mainly on promoting gun rights. With over five million members, its efforts to do so have halted any real progress in America's war on guns. Although the majority of these members do support gun control measures, the distorted view of those in command has suppressed any legal progression. The NRA claims that background checks on gun purchases is excessive and unnecessary. This view, however, is only supported by a quarter of its members. Elite members, particularly president Wayne LaPierre and individuals on the board of directors, agree that the second amendment should be protected at all costs. Another issue the NRA has been adamant about is the need for assault weapons and weapons with large magazines. It claims that assault weapons make the United States safer and reduce crime. A ban on them, according to the NRA, would violate Americans second amendment rights. The NRA opposes both background checks and gun registration. It contends that both would be futile in the fight against gun violence. Its stance is built on the premise that since America has become flooded with danger from illegal gun sales, it would not be worthwhile to try to monitor legal ones. This simply encourages loopholes in legal practices, thus making it feasible and commonplace to play the system. Another issue the NRA has promoted is the ability of people on the Terrorist Watch List  to purchase firearms. Between 2004 and 2010, over 1,100 people on the Terrorist Watch List purchased guns or explosives from U.S. gun dealers. This figure is acceptable to the NRA, however, because some people are wrongly placed on the list.
      <br /><br />
    	The NRA has played a massive part in politics since its inception and its impact has only increased in recent years. Every year of a major election, the NRA gives each candidate a grade. A candidate's grade is determined by his views on major gun issues as well as his impact regarding those views. Candidates receiving high grades such as A or A+ are more favorable to the NRA and are generally endorsed by it. Notable examples are former presidential candidate, John McCain, and current candidate, Rick Santorum. McCain has received over half a million dollars from the NRA and other gun organizations. Santorum has received nearly one hundred thousand dollars from the NRA and other gun advocacy groups. He and his wife have gone so far as to make their daughter a member of the NRA at just three years old. The NRA has begun giving grades to candidates in the 2016 presidential election. Two top candidates, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, are among those given an A+ by the NRA.
      <br /><br />
    	With over one million young people participating in the NRA's shooting events, the NRA appears only to be growing. As gun violence becomes a major focus of the United States, the NRA continues to gain members and support. In the six months after the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the NRA's membership grew by ten percent to surpass five million people nationwide. The NRA exploits these types of events to promote membership; just after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, Wayne LaPierre asked, "How many Bostonians wished they had a gun two weeks ago?" This insensitivity and nonsensical approach to gun tragedies is what the NRA has come to be defined as. Gun violence will never cease so long as the NRA remains rigid in their views toward guns.
