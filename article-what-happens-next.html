      Well the excitement and drama of Super Tuesday has come and gone and many people may be wondering, "what now?" To answer that question we need to step back and first look at what happened leading up to Tuesday and then the results of Tuesday's pollings.
      <br/><br/>
      Leading up to Tuesday Donald Trump led the Republican nomination by a delegate count of 82, followed by Ted Cruz with 17, and Marco Rubio with 16. The amount of delegates required by a candidate to clinch the nomination of the Republican party is 1,273. On Tuesday 11 states were up for grabs with a total of 595 delegates to distribute. States can distribute their delegates in many different ways and it isn't always a winner-takes-all scenario. In order to secure all the delegates from a certain state you must earn a certain percentage of the votes. These percentages vary state by state but at a minimum you must earn at least 50% of the votes to be in contention to win all the delegates. None of the candidates reached this point in any of the 11 states, thus the delegates were distributed proportionately. For Virginia the delegates were distributed based on the vote percentage each candidate earned. In Massachusetts each candidate  had to earn at least 5% to earn delegates. Minnesota requires 10% and in Alaska 13%. Oklahoma and Arkansas require at least 15%, and Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont all required at least 20% of the votes to earn delegates. Since none of the candidates in any of the states broke the 50% or higher mark that left a lot of delegates to be divided up. How and who they went to is the important part in judging the outlook of the race for the nomination.
      <br/><br/>
      Georgia, Vermont, and Virginia were the first three polls to close, and included some of the closest races of the day. Georgia, the first state to declare a winner went to Donald Trump easily, who accumulated nearly 40% of the votes and earned himself 40 out of the 76 total delegates. Rubio, 24.4% with 17 delegates, and Cruz 23.6% with 16 delegates, collected the rest. Vermont and Virginia came down to the wire with Trump ending up with the overall victory in each state. Virginia finished close with Trump topping Rubio 34.7% to 31.9%. The delegates were distributed to all candidates though so Trump earned 17 followed by Rubio with 16, Cruz with eight, Kasich with five, and Carson with three. Vermont, the final of the first three polling stations, was a very close race with Trump beating out Kasich 32.7% to 30.4%. They were the only two candidates to break the 20% mark and each earned six delegates.
      <br/><br/>
      The next four polls to close were Alabama, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. Alabama, Massachusetts, and Tennessee all were easily won by Trump with his biggest margin coming in Massachusetts where he won by 31.3% over Kasich's 18%. Rubio followed with 17.9% and Cruz also broke the 5% required with 9.6% of the vote. The delegate count for Massachusetts followed as such: 22 to trump, eight to Kasich and Rubio, and four to Cruz. Alabama followed with Trump earning 36 delegates, Cruz taking 13, and Rubio earning the one remaining delegate. Tennessee also went Trump's way with him taking 31 delegates followed by Cruz with 14 and Rubio with nine. Oklahoma featured the first state won by someone other than Trump. Ted Cruz secured the victory with 34.4% of the vote to Trump's 28.3% and earned 14 delegates. Trump collected 12 delegates and Rubio rounded it out with 26% of the vote and 11 delegates.
      <br/><br/>
      The final four states featured three different winners. Cruz took his home state of Texas as well as Alaska, Trump won Arkansas, and Rubio took Minnesota. For Cruz, his win in Texas earned him the most delegates of anyone in one state, taking 99 of the possible 155. Trump followed with 38 delegates and Rubio took the remaining four. In Alaska Cruz also claimed victory, edging out Trump 36.4% to 33.5%. Cruz and Trump earned 12 and 11 delegates respectively while Rubio cleaned up the remaining five with 15.1% of the vote. Arkansas was taken by Trump with 32.8% of the vote to Cruz's 30.5%. Trump came away with 16 delegate, Cruz with 14, and Rubio the remaining nine. The final poll of the day was Minnesota, the lone state won by Marco Rubio. He topped Cruz by earning 36.5% of the vote, earning 17 delegates compared to Cruz's 29% and 13 delegates. Trump followed with 21.3% and eight delegates.
      <br/><br/>
      So, after seeing all those numbers and percentages you might be thinking, "what was the overall outcome of Super Tuesday voting and what does it mean for the future?" Well the immediate impact was the change in the delegate totals of the candidates vying for the nomination. While some people expected Trump to all but run away with the race, this did not occur. At first glance it certainly appears that way. Trump won a total of seven out of the possible 11 states, Cruz claimed three, and Rubio took the remaining one. The magic number to clinch the nomination is 1,273 and after Super Tuesday voting the delegate count stood as follows:
      </p><p class="a_body_text_tabbed">
      1. Donald Trump: 319 (+237)<br/>
      2. Ted Cruz: 226 (+209)<br/>
      3. Marco Rubio: 110 (+94)<br/>
      4. John Kasich: 25 (+19)<br/>
      5. Ben Carson: 8 (+3)
      </p><p class="a_body">
      While the gap did grow between the candidates, the race remains incredibly open between the top three of Trump, Cruz, and Rubio. The following two weeks will be what will define the race of the nomination.
      <br/><br/>
      In the span of 10 days, starting on March 5th and concluding on March 15th, 17 states will hold primaries. That is a total of 723 delegates available. The main difference between these upcoming primaries is that not all of them are proportional, when the delegates are divided up between candidates unless a candidate reaches a certain percentage of votes. Five states will hold winner-take-all primaries on March 15th. Four of these states carry a high number of delegates as well and can be what makes or breaks a candidate's race. Florida (99), Illinois (69), Missouri (52), and Ohio (66) are the four big ticket states that the winners will claim all the delegates. Another point that will make these states interesting is that two of them, Florida and Ohio, are home states of the candidates running. If Rubio fails to win Florida and Kasich fails to win Ohio it will be a severe blow to their future prospects of earning the nomination and could lead to the decision to end their campaigns. Also, besides the fact that these votes could give the much needed boost to catch up and pull ahead in the race to candidates like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, it is also a golden opportunity for front runner Donald Trump to all but guarantee his nomination for the presidency. The following two weeks will prove vital in showing what the future holds for not only the GOP nomination, but for the future of America itself.
